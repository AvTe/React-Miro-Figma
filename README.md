# React Miro Figma

![React Miro Figma](https://example.com/react-miro-figma.png)

React Miro Figma is a web application built with React.js that allows users to create virtual collaborative canvases similar to Miro and Figma. This project simplifies the process of collaborative virtual brainstorming and idea-sharing by providing basic features like dragging cards around the canvas, adding new cards, and panning and zooming the canvas.

## Introduction

Miro and Figma are online collaborative canvas-type tools that became very popular during the pandemic. They enable teams to collaborate virtually in ways that feel familiar from the physical world, such as adding virtual post-it notes and other elements to a virtual canvas. However, these tools use complex technologies like WebAssembly, WebGL, and C++ due to their demanding performance requirements.

React Miro Figma provides a simpler alternative using React and TypeScript, focusing on supporting one type of 'card' that contains simple text. While it may not match the performance of Miro or Figma, it provides enough functionality for simpler needs.

## Features

- Dragging cards around the canvas
- Adding new cards to the canvas
- Panning and zooming the canvas
